Some filaments are not available as 3&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.75&amp;nbsp;mm filament allows for finer control, because feeding in 1&amp;nbsp;mm of filament corresponds to less plastic extruded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.75&amp;nbsp;mm filament requires less force to extrude. Compressing 1.75&amp;nbsp;mm down to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm takes less force than doing the same to 3&amp;nbsp;mm filament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the advantages are fairly minor.

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.protoparadigm.com/news-updates/the-difference-between-abs-and-pla-for-3d-printing/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; site. Feel free to add suggestions in the form of comments and I will try to incorporate them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Stronger, machinable, more flexible, and more temperature&#xA;resistant than PLA. Typically printed on a heated bed. Warping is a common problem when printing ABS.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Wider range of filaments available, easier and in some cases faster to print. Not as strong as ABS and the fact that its biodegradable could be seen as both a benefit and a drawback.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Material Properties:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Strong plastic with mild flexibility. Naturally beige in color. Can be filled and sanded. Higher temperature. Easy to recycle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Not as strong as ABS but more rigid. Naturally transparent. More difficult to fill and sand. Can sag in hot temperatures. Sourced from organic matter so it can be broken down in commercial compost facilities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part Accuracy:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Part warping is a significant issue. Sharp corners will often be rounded.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Less heat required contributes to less warping. Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Safety and Handling:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS: Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS. Health concerns have been raised regarding airborne ultrafine particles generated while printing with ABS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.atmosenv.2013.06.050&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;). ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;PLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature. Moisture can also be absorbed into PLA and can irreversibly damage it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;h2&gt;It probably won't be fair.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I have a decent amount of experience with 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It depends heavily on the particular technology that you're using to do the 3D printing, but nearly all forms of printing aren't perfect--depending on the design you make (solid? honeycombed? hollow?), there will be slight, or not-so-slight variations across the faces, which will result in an unfair die. In particular, the faces that are parallel to the build surface will probably be different compared to the ones that are angled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could probably deal with some of these problems with some kind of post-processing, but honestly at that point buying dice would be easier. 3D printing is for making custom or prototype objects, and isn't really suited to mass production of simple shapes like dice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even manufactured dice have some imperfections, and a slightly unfair die probably won't make much of a difference in gameplay, but it will be hard for you to determine whether the imperfections from 3D printing are severe enough to make the die unfair without rolling it many times and looking at its distribution. Again, at that point, it's easier to just buy the dice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, custom d20s can be super cool looking, and if you're going to 3D print something, might as well make it look cool...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <title Title="Different infill in the same part"/>

    <topAnswer>
      <score Score="37"/>
      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;This answer explains that you can have different infill within the same part. Firstly the implementation in &lt;strong&gt;Ultimaker Cura&lt;/strong&gt; is described, secondly how you can do this in &lt;strong&gt;Slic3r&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Ultimaker Cura&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've used a feature in &lt;strong&gt;Ultimaker Cura&lt;/strong&gt; that can be used to alter the infill density locally. What you need to do is load your model into Cura, then load other objects (models) at the size of the area/volume you want your infill differently and position those at the position you want a different infill. Alternatively, you can add support blocker cubes that can be used as well.  So basically, you use other models to intersect with your primary model to create intersections that can take a different infill percentage (please note that you can alter even more options, as long as you add these to the intersecting volume). This is extremely useful for lugs and brackets where you need some extra infill (e.g. extra stiffness for compression stresses) at the fastener holes. Note that this is an advanced feature which is not easy to use, but quite handy if you master it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could not find the video (&lt;em&gt;on second thoughts, I think it was animated GIF&lt;/em&gt;) posted by Team Ultimaker, so I quote a section of one of their forum topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.ultimaker.com/topic/20470-infill-density-for-smaller-parts/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;A short how-to:&lt;/a&gt; (italic font is not in the reference, but added to reflect recent version of Cura)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unselect &amp;quot;keep models apart&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;(now called: &amp;quot;Ensure models are kept apart&amp;quot;)&lt;/em&gt; and &amp;quot;drop models to build plate&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;(now called: &amp;quot;Automatically drop models to the build plate&amp;quot;)&lt;/em&gt; in Cura preferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Import a second object (for example a simple cube)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Put Cura in &amp;quot;custom mode&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Select the cube, and use the button &amp;quot;per object settings&amp;quot; on the left side&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Select &amp;quot;Infill Mesh&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;(now called: &amp;quot;Modify settings for infill of other models&amp;quot;)&lt;/em&gt; and enable that setting&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cube now turns transparent gray.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Position the cube to overlap part of your model. It should overlap with the section that you want to change the infill for.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also with &amp;quot;per object settings&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;(now called: &amp;quot;Per model settings&amp;quot;)&lt;/em&gt; select the option &amp;quot;infill density&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set it to the desired value. All is more or less illustrated in the screenshot below&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The picture shows a cube on the buildplate with infill 20 %. Locally, with a rotated 2nd cube, the infill % is raised to 100 %.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What happens is that the volume where the cube intersects with your object is locally sliced with different infill.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIjIj.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIjIj.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of a cube with different infill settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please find below another example of a simple bracket that has extra cylindrical objects loaded to create the intersections with the bracket at the fastener holes. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.ultimaker.com/topic/20470-infill-density-for-smaller-parts/?do=findComment&amp;amp;comment=193146&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, the infill at the fastener holes is set to 99 %.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqSpA.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqSpA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of local 99 % infill at bracket fastener holes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After slicing, you will see that the infill at the intersections is adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/v9guy.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/v9guy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Detail of sliced bracket showing local infill percentage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I've tested this in Ultimaker Cura 3.4.1, and confirm it works. I sliced a part with the inserts for fasteners and it actually is not very difficult, it just requires a little more work. You will have to make some STL's of cylinders and position them correctly. If you make your own 3D models it will be a very easy task to add extra components while you design, positioning will be a lot more easy then (as they align with your model). An example is the following linear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4441751/files&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Z rod bracket of a Hypercube Evolution CoreXY printer&lt;/a&gt;, this bracket requires local reinforcements for the bolts clamping the bracket onto the aluminum extrusion profile:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zVlF1.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Hypercube Evolution Z rod bracket&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/zVlF1.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; title=&quot;Hypercube Evolution Z rod bracket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inserts are modeled together with the development of the bracket:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/w8XlM.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Hypercube Evolution Z rod bracket insert&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/w8XlM.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; title=&quot;Hypercube Evolution Z rod bracket insert&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When combined, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qJszQ.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Hypercube Evolution Z rod bracket and bracket insert&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qJszQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; title=&quot;Hypercube Evolution Z rod bracket and bracket insert&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the infill can be modified locally to 100 % to increase compression strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this will also work if you want a different infill percentage at the first X layers, just use a large cube (larger than the model) and position it correctly. Note that Cura already has an option called &amp;quot;Gradual Infill Steps&amp;quot; to adjust the density at the top layers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Slic3r&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/modifier-mesh&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;This reference&lt;/a&gt; describes how to do this for &lt;strong&gt;Slic3r&lt;/strong&gt; in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The blog describes the use of a simple volume (the green volume loaded from an STL file). After loading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right-clicking on the main part brought up the object settings menu.&#xA;From there, clicking &amp;quot;Load Modifier&amp;quot; and selecting the previously&#xA;saved model adds it to the part as a modifier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The green &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; was selected and &amp;quot;Fill Density&amp;quot; was added to modifier&#xA;list and set to 100 %.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/llvIG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/llvIG.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Part with box for alternative mesh infill&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/EslBH.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/EslBH.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;This shows that the functionality in Slic3r is very similar to the functionality in Ultimaker Cura.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

In 2017, MIT&#xA;  researchers discovered that when graphene was shaped into a gyroid&#xA;  structure, it had exceptional strength properties at low densities.&#xA;  They then discovered however, that the crucial aspect of this was&#xA;  actually the gyroid structure itself, and that other materials such as&#xA;  plastic could benefit from this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that this type of infill has better properties against failure than the normal types of infill we know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A test conducted by an author named Martin is found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cartesiancreations.com.au/gyroid-infill-tests/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;There is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) &lt;a href=&quot;http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/399&quot;&gt;do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its &quot;natural&quot; origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since &quot;natural&quot; materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against &quot;natural&quot; materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire86/art017.html&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a &quot;safer&quot; printers or using &quot;safer&quot; materials diminish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rafts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rafts are a few layers of plastic a placed on the printing surface before the object is printed.  If non water dissoluble filament is used, a bit of an air gap will be placed between the raft and the print itself so it can be removed easily. A raft can help a print stick to the printing surface as it normally has a larger surface area than the bottom of the print.  It also allows the bottom layers of the print to contact another layer of plastic so there is less spreading compared to printing on the printing bed itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rOghMm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rOghMm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A raft in Slic3r (green)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skirts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Skirts are loops of plastic that are extruded around the object that is being printed.  On the first layer this allows the filament to get pushed through the extruder so that a steady flow can be established.  A multiple layer skirt can be used to create a blockage around the print so there is less air movement on the print and the print can cool slower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1XEmnm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1XEmnm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A skirt in Slic3r (green)&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brims:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A brim is a layer of plastic that is placed on the first layer of the print go allow for better adhesion to the printing surface.

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are many different approaches to solving this issue and most of the answers already are spot-on. However, the fundamental reason for the &quot;warping&quot; is incorrect and inconsistent temperature across the material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is too much fluctuation in the temperature across the object in this heated state can result in warping. The reason you see this mostly on the build plate is because the temperature of the first few layers of molten plastic vary much more against the build plate than against higher layers. Note that you can see additional warping mid-print using ABS and this can be a result of a draft or sudden drop in ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to help solve your problem, here are some suggestions (sorry if there are duplicates):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Completely &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1292/should-i-enclose-my-3d-printer&quot;&gt;enclose/seal your machine's build area&lt;/a&gt; to reduce (or eliminate if possible) draft and prevent the natural heat of the machine from escaping.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Increase the temperature on your build plate. I almost exclusively use ABS on my printer and I keep my HBP at about 112C. However, I live in the NW of the US, so my climate is naturally cooler than say Florida.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/1251/how-to-choose-an-extrusion-temperature&quot;&gt;try decreasing the nozzle temperature&lt;/a&gt; to a lower point within the ABS melting range. This will just shorten the gap between the inconsistencies in temperature across layers. It is typically better to print at lower temperatures if you can help it. Obviously there are differences in the filament, so you'll have to find that &quot;sweet spot&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/470/bed-leveling-method/479#479&quot;&gt;Ensure your build plate is flat&lt;/a&gt; and your tape doesn't have bubbles. Your BP being flat should be a no brainer, but if your kapton tape (or whatever you use) has bubbles, your freshly printed plastic may not be getting the same temperature from the BP as the rest of your part. This is a bad thing as mentioned earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use extra adhesion techniques such as &quot;ABS Glue&quot; (ABS w/ acetone) or even hairspray. This works about 80% of the time for me, but can make it a bit difficult when removing the parts off the BP.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with any linked brand or company, I just link to them for reference of the suggested print settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What is PLA?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PLA is, by its definition PolyLacticAcid, a polymer of entwined lactic acids. It is commonly made from fermenting starch - not via Type I (alcohol) but Type II (lactic acid) fermentation&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/12857/user77232&quot;&gt;user77232&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_fermentation&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

This can change the standard printing temperature depending on the amount, size and shape of the pigments embedded (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Common Printing temperatures are listed by the manufacturers in the range of 185 to 210 °C. The color can have an influence on the printing temperature, especially for the difference between transparent and opaque filaments. While a heated bed is not strictly necessary, the bed temperature is usually quoted with 60 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I myself print most PLA filaments at 200 °C and 60 °C bed, but for noncolored transparent filament, I had better results using 190 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that not all PLA is just PLA! It is very likely that some PLA brands contain fillers and additives from the house without claiming to be a +-filament, indeed, additives precede the idea of PLA+, as the case with Tiertime PP3DP filaments will show.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The special Tiertime mixture&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since back in 2012 or earlier, ABS made by Tiertime includes some unknown compound (possibly PC) that alters the best-result print temperature from the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; 220 - 240 °C to the much higher but narrower 260 - 270 °C band. Why this is done is a mystery among 3d-printing enthusiasts, but it might be either to get rid of any color-dependency of the print results or to make it harder to use generic ABS. Fact is, that this temperature was matching what was set as the (then unchangeable) standard temperature in the &lt;em&gt;Up 1.1.7&lt;/em&gt; software of that time.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiertime.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8233&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Angus aka MakersMuse&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiertime.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8233&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tiertime Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

Well, PLA+ is a &lt;em&gt;modified&lt;/em&gt; PLA, which means that it has additives in it to alter its properties. What exactly is added depends extremely on the manufacturer, and no two PLA+ are the same.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://all3dp.com/2/pla-vs-pla-3d-printer-filament-compared/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;all3dp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What is the difference?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PLA+ has - but for a few degrees - the same printing temperature as standard PLA. In fact, the printing temperature difference between standard PLA from different brands is often larger than the difference between PLA and PLA+.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://all3dp.com/2/pla-vs-pla-3d-printer-filament-compared/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;All3dp&lt;/a&gt; claims, that most PLA+ would have a better surface finish than the PLA from the same brand. Because of the additives, they also usually print best at elevated temperature compared to PLA. Among various manufacturers, I saw 210–240 °C&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B079VYGNRG&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kodak PLA+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 190-220 °C&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/SUNLU-Filament-Printing-Dimensional-Accuracy/dp/B073P9LZWB&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;SUNLU PLA+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and 190-210 °C&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/eSun-Filament-Universal-Thing-matic/dp/B01KM6MDFG&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;eSun PLA+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there is no uniformity in other effects on the filament. Some filaments would have less moisture absorption, a different stiffness or compressibility while others might have a higher tensile strength and feature an extremely glossy surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most commonly, the claimed benefits lie in the fields of the filament's strength, surface texture and glossiness, the printability of overhangs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PLA+ is &lt;strong&gt;not one product&lt;/strong&gt; per se but &lt;strong&gt;a family of modified PLA&lt;/strong&gt;. While you can print PLA+ with the same settings as normal PLA, the resulting benefits between different brands are much more diverse than with normal PLA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Changing between different brands of &lt;em&gt;similar quality&lt;/em&gt; normal PLA has usually little to no effect on the print's general properties.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Changing between different brands of &lt;em&gt;similar quality&lt;/em&gt; PLA+ can alter the print's properties immensely&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of the fact that no two brands of PLA+ are the same (and the manufacturers are silent on what additives they use to change the properties), one should not rely on the same effects when switching between brands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It sounds like you know such values already from experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure out the speed in the middle: &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$(L+H)/2$&lt;/span&gt;.

Keep repeating until &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$L$&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$H$&lt;/span&gt; get as close as you want; say, within 5&amp;nbsp;% of each other or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't bother trying to get super-close, because the workable value will vary somewhat over time (friction from dust getting on various parts; slight voltage differences; different mass and pulling tension for the filament roll, temperature of motors, complexity of the object you're printing, behavior of the slicing program you use, you name it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;It makes a difference where I live, and I'm not in a particularly humid climate (California).  When printing with wet filament, you'll sometimes hear it popping and see steam coming out of the extruder (it's usually only this extreme with nylon).  With most other filaments, when they're wet, the extruded filament will have small bubbles in it and the surface finish of the parts will be rougher, with breaks in the layer lines.  It can also lead to more oozing and stringing.  Air print a few centimeters of filament and look at it closely to see if there's any bubbles, if not, it's probably dry enough.  Whether the filament absorbs enough water to be noticeable in a few hours, in a day, or in a week depends a lot on the filament (and I assume the humidity too).  I'm mostly noticed problems with nylon, ABS, and NinjaFlex, less with PLA and PETG (though I avoid leaving any filament out for more than a day).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not seeing any difference between, then I wouldn't worry about it.

Others (Cyanoacrylate) are not heat-stable and break down into their components under heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Use proper protection when working with glue! Eye protection and respiratory protection, as well as gloves, are to be used when necessary. Read the manual of the products you are working with!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Preparations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most glues, it is advisable to prepare the surface: sand it to increase the surface area, remove grease from fingerprints etc. Follow the manual!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Glues&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cyanoacrylate - yep, the &amp;quot;one kind for all&amp;quot; is a solution for PLA too: Superglue. However, look out for what type you get! Some are clearly better than others, and using an accelerator can change the properties of the glue spot.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Together with talcum powder, CA glue (&amp;quot;superglue&amp;quot;) can fill gaps easily. However, a gap-bridging bond isn't the strongest, and working can be finicky. Yet if the parts do sit flush, a CA glue bond can be a almost as strong as any 2-component glue bond tested, according to Tom.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CA is not stable under heating and when heated too much it breaks apart into a rather noxious fume!&lt;/strong&gt; This can be handy to break metal-CA-metal bonds in machining of small parts but keep this in mind if you want to use inserts or plastic-soler pieces on the same areas! Don't tack with CA in those cases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Epoxy resin - Epoxy is a favorite for very tough gluing, a few droplets can stick a car to the roof... and it warms up in curing. If you take a slow&#xA;curing resin, you can safely use it to glue PLA without the part deforming.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncured Resin and their hardeners are strong skin irritants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2-Component Acrylic resin is just as good as epoxy often, as Tom noticed. It's very comparable to Epoxy in performance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adhesives.org/adhesives-sealants/adhesives-sealants-overview/adhesive-technologies/chemically-curing/two-component-(2-c)/urethane-adhesives&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Urethanes&lt;/a&gt; - 2 Component Urethanes offer strong but flexible bonds and work great according to Joel. Their curing process is also exothermic, so take care to not 'cook' your piece.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2-phase Putty - in a similar vein come 2-phase putties like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.games-workshop.com/en-FI/Green-Stuff&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Green Stuff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.milliput.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Miliputt&lt;/a&gt;, which harden after mixing. Their heat generation isn't too big and they allow to fill gaps easily. My favorite stuff though is not the expensive modeling putty but the stuff from the home depot: stuff like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pattex.de/do-it-yourself-mit-pattex-klebstoffe-produkte-new/pattex-klebstoffe/reparaturkleber/repair-express.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pattex Repair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sorry, no English site for this&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uhu.com/en/products/epoxy-adhesives-2-component/detail/uhu-repair-all-powerkitt-1.html?cHash=e0f929a3ec974e591e89c5e1987a30ab&amp;amp;step=70&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;UHU Repair All Powerkitt&lt;/a&gt; harden within an hour, are surprisingly cheap and get a smooth surface.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acetone - We all know that you can smooth and glue ABS with Acetone or an acetone-ABS slurry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZUfq0yrtv4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tom (Thomas Sanladerer)&lt;/a&gt; made a few experiments with it. He discovered that it works for at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; types of PLA in the following fashion: apply some acetone to a spot and press the second piece (that also was prepared this way) to it and they might melt themselves together after some time.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Effectivity of this depends &lt;strong&gt;very highly&lt;/strong&gt; on the exact PLA you got.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acetone is highly flammable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There's a type of glues commonly called &amp;quot;Kraftkleber&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Alleskleber&amp;quot; in Germany, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uhu.com/en/products/special-adhesives/detail/uhu-hart-kunststoff-1.html?cHash=9e818145273de580c4e3c132faad3710&amp;amp;step=202&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;UHU Hart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pattex.de/do-it-yourself-mit-pattex-klebstoffe-produkte-new/pattex-klebstoffe/kontaktkleber-gel-fuer-schwierige-oberflaechen/kraftkleber-transparent.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pattex Kraftkleber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;German&lt;/sup&gt;. While they often &lt;em&gt;stick&lt;/em&gt; to PLA, I personally don't like their gluing power and find them often quite messy to work with. Also, they very much fail in loadbearing joints.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wood Glue - Yes, Wood Glue. PVA Wood glue as well as its non-water-soluble cousin (&amp;quot;Express&amp;quot;) have proven themselves to me as a rather nice surface coating to smooth over print lines as well as a good solution to affix paper and wood to prints. It is less of a solution for plastic-plastic bonds but works OK-ish.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Glue? Why glue?!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;Solder&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What better way is there to combine parts than welding or soldering?! Often none. My personal all-time-favorite PLA &lt;em&gt;glue&lt;/em&gt; is PLA itself, by using it as &lt;strong&gt;PLA solder&lt;/strong&gt;. This method also works for most other filament types, but is not advisable for ABS and other plastics that emit fumes without wearing respiratory protection! In any case, you need to work with an exhaust, as you heat your plastic in a not always fully controllable way. If you can, use a soldering station where you can set the temperature of the iron.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take the pieces and make sure on both sides is a cavity that can be filled.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take a soldering iron and set it to around 200°C.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take a length of PLA filament.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Melt the filament with the soldering iron and use it as solder when combining the two pieces. Make sure that at least some filament gets into the cavities and sticks there - it can help to stick the soldering iron into the goop in there to force it to merge with the infill/walls and press together to hot PLA goop filled pieces against the iron before pulling it away, pressing the pieces together.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As the PLA cools and hardens, the joint is usually tougher than the actual layer boundaries.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Pen&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of using a soldering iron, one might also use a 3D printing pen&lt;sup&gt;One that eats filament, not one for PCL or some gel!&lt;/sup&gt;, but I don't like those personally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Inserts!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a different note, a soldering iron is also a very good solution to make inserts into PLA - heat up the metal insert (like a nut) and press it into an undersized hole, and it will mold the plastic around itself into a perfect fit without any glue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Friction Welding&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to using direct heat from a soldering iron is &lt;strong&gt;friction welding&lt;/strong&gt;. For this, take a rotary power tool and some filament. Insert the filament into the tool, tighten and cut so that about an inch is reaching out of the claw. Turn it on at medium speed, about 800 to 1200 RPM. Now, once you press the tip of the spinning filament against other PLA it gets hot and melts, creating a welding seam. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa2DoE3sirU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; has a good explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;Food safety is a property of both the process and the material. You can't stick food-safe material in a printer that has previously been used to print something food-dangerous and expect the result to be food safe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only way to know if a given material is food-safe is to ask your supplier, but a lot depends on how you then process it. For instance, FDM printers often have brass nozzles, which contain lead.

Some claims circulate on the internet that 3D printed models may have surface porosity in which bacteria can grow, but I've not been able to find a reliable source for this claim. Still, you need to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <score Score="23"/>
    <topAnswer>
      <score Score="7"/>
      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;Thermocouples work by passively generating VERY small voltages via the Seebeck effect -- usually a few tens of millivolts. They're literally just a pair of wires made from two different special alloys, electrically connected together at the &quot;hot&quot; end. That wire junction can be mounted inside whatever kind of attachment tip or lug is desired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that they're very simple and passive devices makes them extremely precise and consistent between TCs of the same type, MUCH more so than thermistors. Any type-K thermocouple in the world will give you the same accurate output +/-1-2C or so. You can even cut a thermocouple in half, re-twist the ends of the wires together, and it'll still work! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the very small (millivolts) signal they generate is quite susceptible to electrical noise and circuit design. The signal voltage has to be greatly amplified to be useful. So it doesn't take much EMR from your heater or stepper wires to interfere with the TC reading. A frequent problem with TC circuits in 3d printers is the dreaded GROUND LOOP -- if the &quot;hot&quot; tip is electrically connected to the hot block, voltage and current on the heater and motor wires can induce small currents through the TC wires that totally screw up the millivolt signal. The amplifier picks up these stray voltages and it throws off the temp read. So, there are some important guidelines for keeping noise out of the TC wires:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The TC wires must be electrically insulated from the mounting hardware (eye lug, thermowell, whatever your extruder has). You can check this with a multimeter -- you want infinite / out of range resistance from the TC leads to the mounting tip and hot block. While you're at it, make sure your heater cartridge wires aren't shorting to the hot block -- that's unsafe and can also cause problems with TCs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keep the two TC wires close together, and not immediately parallel to noise sources like PWM-controlled heaters or stepper wiring. If you must run the TC in a bundle with the other wires, TWIST the heater/stepper wiring pairs. (For steppers, twist each coil pair to a different pitch if possible. You don't need to twist the separate coil pairs to each other.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another common issue with TC circuits is the COLD JUNCTION COMPENSATION. A thermocouple doesn't measure tip temperature, it measures the DIFFERENCE in temperature between the hot tip and the cold junction where the TC is connected to either the amp or copper wiring. The TC amp has an onboard thermistor that it uses to add the temp at the cold junction to the measured signal from the thermocouple. There are a few things you need to do to make sure the cold-junction compensation works properly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You should run TC wire all the way from the &quot;hot&quot; tip to the TC amp. You CAN splice it and install plugs, but only with more type-K TC wire and proper type-K thermocouple plugs. These use the same metal as the TC wire so they don't generate undesired junction voltages that interfere with the TC signal. If you splice copper wire between the TC and the amp, any temp differences along the copper will not be measured! This is a particularly big problem if you splice to copper inside a warm enclosure and then run copper to an amp outside the enclosure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The amp should not be super hot. The onboard thermistor is designed to accurately measure temperatures reasonably close to room temp, not hot-block temps. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There should not be large temperature gradients near the amp or between the TC wire termination and the actual amp chip. Place the amp far enough away from the hot end and other heat sources (like stepper motors) that it isn't experiencing weird temp profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do the above, the TC will output a good signal, and the amp will read it properly. But there's one more hitch. The mainboard has to know how to understand the amp's output. 3D printer control boards that are designed exclusively for TCs, like Mightyboards, usually use digital communication between the amp and the main control chip (MCU). This is high-reliability and does not require any special firmware configuration -- support is baked in. But if you're strapping an external TC amp onto a board that is expecting thermistors, &lt;strong&gt;you will have to tell the firmware how to read the signal from the amp.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common technique is for the amp to output a linear voltage signal to the MCU's normal thermistor input (ADC). Then you configure the firmware to use the appropriate &quot;thermistor table&quot; (really a voltage lookup table) for that particular amp. Depending on your controller board, you also may need to make sure the regular thermistor pull-up/pull-down resistors aren't affecting the amp's output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you need to make sure:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You don't have electrical noise issues&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cold-junction compensation is working as intended&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The firmware and controller board is configured correctly for your amp chip's output&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do all that, a TC should give superior accuracy and reliability over a thermistor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;3D printer controllers have to do a lot of stuff very, very fast. Performing kinematics and dynamics calculations while sending many thousands of precisely-synchronized step pulses per second is &lt;em&gt;really, really hard&lt;/em&gt;. The 8bit AVR line of microcontrollers used in older 3D printer controllers is basically a late-1990s era Mr Coffee processor. They are completely, utterly maxed out on processor time just executing basic printing functions in simple (eg Cartesian) printers, and adding additional calculation load will bog them down and cause slowdowns, stuttering, pausing, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But my 8bit printer works fine,&quot; you say. No, it doesn't. Your print performance is limited by it, whether you realize it or not. Slicers now automatically hide a lot of the firmware's performance shortcomings from you. For example, the standard practice of greatly slowing down print speeds on perimeters is largely a result of 8bit processors having inadequate resources for two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Performing centripetal acceleration calculations for curves&#xA;across multiple gcode segments &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keeping up with gcode transmission/processing and motion planning for gcode with lots of very small segments, such as in organic models or smooth arcs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When presented with a series of very small segments in a smooth arc or complex curve, the 8bit firmware will likely choke on the required command processing rate and introduce stuttering to the print. These incredibly brief pauses allow residual pressure in the extruder to push out some extra plastic, making a little zit on the print. So most slicers automatically decimate curves and output gcode with reduced resolution to lighten the load on the firmware. Problem solved, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's another issue -- the GRBL motion control algorithms underlying all the major open source 3D printer controllers were designed with lots of shortcuts and hacks to allow 8bit processors to execute fast enough. For example, the basic algorithm only looks at the speed or velocity change at the corner between two segments, and uses that to decide when to decelerate/accelerate along the direction of motion. It does not calculate or consider centripetal/radial acceleration whatsoever. This is a really effective hack when printing boxy, low-res models, but it fails miserably on smooth curves with lots of little segments. The firmware does not detect any appreciable velocity change at the corner of any two nearly-linear segments within the faceted curve, and thus does not slow down for the curve. So complex geometry is effectively printed at constant velocity, with no acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Printing complex perimeters unaccelerated means the commanded feedrate must be very low to get good quality. Most printers are limited to about 40mm/s or less on complex perimeters, despite being able to run perhaps 80-120mm/s on low-complexity infill before hitting other speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Between the command processing rate limits and motion planner shortcomings required by low power processors, print speeds must be much lower in practice than is strictly required by the physics and printer hardware. This all comes from 8bit processors. The workarounds and best practices to deal with this problem are so deeply baked into the toolchains and ecosystem that very few people realize there is even a problem. But it's a real limit that can be overcome: a high-speed processor running a more rigorous motion planner could generate higher average print speeds with &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; print quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, the ARM-based firmwares are only slowly moving towards more advanced motion planners. This is a big development area right now that is actually driving an upcoming shift away from low-end ARMs like the Cortex M3 towards even faster processors. It's actually not all that hard to max out an 84 MHz Arduino Due by piling on a bunch of firmware features. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of 8bit processors also makes printers LOUDER. The biggest consumer of processor time in a typical 8bit printer is the stepper interrupt that fires the step pulses to make the motors move. It is quite typical for &gt;60% of all clock cycles on an Atmega AVR to go to firing step pulses. Because this occurs as an interrupt, other processing tasks that the printer must perform -- like acceleration calculations and heater control -- get squeezed into the brief spaces between stepper interrupt events. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without careful firmware design, the step pulses will completely &quot;crowd out&quot; other functionality like LCD display updates and acceleration calculations. In order to allow higher motion rates without using all the processor resources, 8bit firmwares have a mode called &quot;step doubling&quot; that fires two (or four, or eight) step pulses per stepper interrupt so that half (or a quarter, or an eighth) as many stepper interrupts can be used to produce the same motion speed. This practice de-bottlenecks the processor, but it causes rougher and louder motor motion because the step pulses are fired in bursts rather than a constant frequency. In effect, the microstepping level of the motor is functionally dropped to a coarser mode when the stepper interrupt fires double or quad steps. So the motors get louder, less precise, and in extreme cases may have problems with resonance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting side effect is that if you switch a Marlin-based printer from 1/16 microstepping to 1/32 microstepping, and keep the same print speeds, the firmware will simply start step-doubling, dropping your effective microstepping level right back down to 1/16.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ARM-based firmwares also use step doubling, but the allowable step rates are typically ~8 times higher before double/quad stepping is used. That can mean higher speeds and/or smoother motion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue with 8bit AVRs is the lack of hardware floating point and need to spend many clock cycles on high-precision calculations or handling very large numbers. Delta kinematics, auto-leveling functions, calculating moves with extremely high step counts for large printers, and other advanced functionality all take a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of clock cycles on an 8bit processor. Poor firmware design or carelessly adding a feature that requires a few extra square roots and trig functions can completely bog down the processor. This kind of feature creep and code bloat has seriously impacted Marlin's performance over time as people ask more and more of the old AVR. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, a 32bit processor doesn't just have a faster clock and more clock cycles, it is also able to do much more complex math in fewer clock cycles, because it has dedicated hardware functionality that takes care of many of the steps an 8bit processor must do in software. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do 8bit processors work? Sure, they work surprisingly well for what they are and what we ask of them. But they unquestionably limit the performance and features of modern 3D printers. Even today's current generation of 32bit processors is already being maxed out by high speed printers and math-heavy features. The 8bit processor is already two generations behind what would qualify as a &quot;modern&quot; 3D printer controller. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;The &quot;obvious&quot; answer is re-grinding the prints and making more filament. Unfortunately, this isn't yet a very economical or simple operation. A decent filament extruder capable of holding acceptable diameter tolerances is around $1000, and even then they can be pretty fidgety to operate. You have to have a LOT of volume throughput in your filament extruder for regrinding to be an economical proposition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the reasons why recycling prints into filament can be difficult:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most plastics will degrade to some extent each time they are extruded. (Both by the 3d printer and by the filament extruder.) PLA will thermally degrade with extended exposure to heat. PET will hydrolyze and break down if not meticulously dried to remove moisture prior to heating to the melting temp. (PETG seems to be less prone to hydrolysis damage than plastic bottle PET, but it still happens to a limited degree.) ABS holds up to extrusion conditions better than most, which is part of why it's favored for injection molding, but there's still the potential to affect properties by depleting additives or cooking out plasticizers. &lt;strong&gt;In practice, this means regrinds generally need to be mixed with fresh pellets at some ratio.&lt;/strong&gt; That dilutes the degraded or additive-depleted polymer with good material so you can maintain the material properties and performance. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you print a variety of different colors, and don't want all your recycled filament to mix and end up a muddy brownish color, it can be difficult to manage the color sorting and matching. Most people don't want different colors along the length of a spool, either. So the regrind has to be mixed evenly in with virgin pellets and a suitable amount of masterbatch colorant to get a reasonable color output. You're not going to run off a new spool with 95% virgin pellets just to recycle a 50 gram failed print, are you? Likewise for material matching. Mixing materials is a bad idea. &lt;strong&gt;If you only print white PLA, this is all pretty easy to manage. But if you print a variety of colors and materials, you've got to set up a material tracking, sorting, and storage operation.&lt;/strong&gt; You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do it... it's just a hassle. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Diameter control is difficult. 3D printers need a fairly tight diameter control for reliable performance and good quality. This is really the key challenge in any filament extrusion process. Extruded polymers like to change shape as they extrude and cool due to molecular alignment effects. You can't just push molten plastic out a 1.75mm nozzle -- &quot;die swell&quot; will make the extrudate bulge to a larger diameter immediately upon exiting the nozzle. Then you have to actually &lt;em&gt;pull&lt;/em&gt; on the soft filament as it cools to carefully draw it down to the right diameter. The way the filament extruder measures diameter and controls tension is the key to getting acceptable results. Most hobbyist/desktop filament extruders have not succeeded at this. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are just the major issues. Filament extrusion is a complex subject with a lot of depth. For a home user of 3d printers, making filament basically becomes a whole second hobby. In my opinion, it only really makes sense in a commercial production printing environment where paid technicians can run the extruder(s) and a very large print throughput makes the pellets+regrind economics much more favorable than just buying new filament. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reducing and reusing are preferable to recycling. Making your printer more reliable and gaining experience with calibration/configuration will reduce the volume of waste produced. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also some productive uses that let you reuse unwanted prints as-is or &quot;downcycle&quot; them for productive uses. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I personally keep a box of failed prints (and calibration prints and&#xA;no-longer-needed prototypes) as showpieces for people who want to&#xA;learn about 3D printing, and as toys for my nieces and nephews. I strongly recommend doing your calibration prints with a &quot;toy&quot; calibration model like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Benchy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1090268&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;CaliBlocks&lt;/a&gt;. 3D printing is still new enough that people will happily take dozens of Benchies off your hands for the novelty value.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Failed and unwanted prints can also be used around the workshop for shims, sacrificial&#xA;cushions when clamping or hammering or drilling, or as scrap for experimenting&#xA;with adhesives or post-processing techniques.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABS scraps are good for making ABS-slurry as a print bed adhesion treatment&#xA;layer, or for solvent-painting and filling gaps in other prints. Unfortunately, most other filaments do not have such convenient and safe solvents.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some people have experimented with putting piles of scrap prints on a cookie sheet in an oven and melting them into multicolor cutting boards. There's a lot you can do with this sort of heavy remelt plate if you get creative. (I personally wouldn't use cheap Asian filaments for food contact though, they often have unpleasant contaminants.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;It is hard to tell whether you personally should enclose your printer. However, you asked for the advantages and I will name some of them on which one can base a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A 3D printer enclosure&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;helps to keep the temperature of the whole print at controlled levels, if you use a heating element, thermocouple and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;pid regulator&lt;/a&gt;. This is one of the most direct uses of the enclosure, which can be achieved by almost no other means. One could sloppily say it does for the whole print what the heatbed does for the initial layers. Controlling the temperature can be beneficial for layer adhesion and can help against delamination problems. This can go as far as fixing cracks and complete delamination (Thanks to @J. Roibal for bringing these cracks to my attention in the comments)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;keeps &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackaday.com/2016/02/01/3d-printing-fumes-new-science/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;dangerous fumes&lt;/a&gt; controlled. Here you can find a scientific study about it, published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Atmospheric Environment 79, titled 'ultrafine particle emission from desktop 3D printers&lt;/a&gt;, on exactly that topic. You can embed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:339128&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;filter with a fan&lt;/a&gt; in your housing to filter the air from all dangerous fumes that are created when melting certain plastic types. It could just circulate the air inside the chamber or get the filtered air out of the housing. This is another use which cannot be achieved otherwise (afaik).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;can keep humidity away from your printer. This is helpful for filaments that attract water (and don't print well under that circumstance). This should be realized separately for stored filament, too, adding some silica gel to regulate humidity. (Thanks to @Obmerk Kronen in the comments)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;minimizes losses of your heatbed. This happens in at least two ways, - the heated bed will also heat the surroundings, that is the inside of the enclosure. By raising its temperature, the temperature difference and hence heat loss is minimized. Also wind, introducing high fluctuations in the transfered (i.e. lost) heat is minimized. In that sense, it also&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;shuts out any wind for print temperature stability. Also dust and particles that could be blown on the print will be shut out (thanks to the addition of dust/particles: @Obmerk Kronen). This is a benefit that comes without having a heated chamber or filter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;helps to keep the printer clean in between use. Your axes will thank you being free from dust.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;reduces smell and noise. If you use the printer in you living area, that alone can be a great benefit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;makes sure that your printer is safe during storage, nothing will fall on it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;can look pretty nice and add to the style of your printer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/3d-Printer-Enclosure-from-Upcycled-Furniture/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;even if selfmade&lt;/a&gt; ;-) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are obviously also downsides, as: connected work/money to make it, increased space used for the printer, and, if not well made for that purpose (which it should be), increased difficulty in repairs and maintenance of the printer itself (i.e. to get the printer out of the enclosure).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

    <topAnswer>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The easiest way to freshen up filament is hot air, although there are other options.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an optimal melt processing &lt;em&gt;moisture level&lt;/em&gt; for every plastic, typically in the range of 0.1-0.2% water content by weight. But the equilibrium moisture content of most plastics in humid air can be more like 1%. As a consequence, &lt;strong&gt;hot air dehydration is standard practice&lt;/strong&gt; to prepare plastic pellets for extrusion in industry. Pretty much every injection-molded and extruded plastic product in the world -- including 3d printer filament -- is made with pre-dried pellets. Hot air is blown through the pellets until they are below the moisture limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different plastics tolerate extrusion with different amounts of moisture, and absorb different amounts of moisture. They can also tolerate different drying temperatures. So the ideal storage and drying conditions vary by material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA&lt;/strong&gt; absorbs relatively little moisture, but in humid environments can accumulate enough water content to cause steam bubbles during extrusion. In some cases, steam bubbles can contribute to hot end jamming. Extreme wetness has been known to cause swelling that can increase filament feed drag. It's arguable whether wetness actually causes brittleness, or if that is a separate aging issue. People who keep their homes below ~50% relative humidity usually don't have any problems. Leaving PLA in a dry environment for a week or two should adequately re-dry it, or it can be gently heated to about 120F / 50C for a couple hours. (Some people dry it hotter. but that risks deforming the filament.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABS&lt;/strong&gt; also doesn't absorb very much water, but perhaps a little more than PLA. It also experiences steam bubbles, but that's typically the only issue. Homes below ~45% RH usually don't have problems. Storing ABS with fresh silica gel for a couple weeks will dry it. Or it can be oven-dried up to about 180F / 80C for an couple hours. &lt;strong&gt;HIPS&lt;/strong&gt; can be treated the same. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The kind of PET used in plastic bottles is rapidly degraded into tar by hydrolysis when melted with any significant water content. So &lt;strong&gt;PETG&lt;/strong&gt; filaments are specially blended to absorb less water and to be less damaged by water than PET. But there is still the possibility of bubbles and cloudy strands due to steam expansion at higher temperatures, and there is some evidence that wet PETG produces weaker, more brittle prints than dry PETG. Different manufacturers' blends require different conditions: some people report Taulman t-glase needs oven-drying and careful storage while Esun PETG is fairly tolerant of normal home humidity levels. Oven-drying at 150F / 65C should work well. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nylon&lt;/strong&gt; absorbs a huge amount of water, which causes it to swell considerably, produce massive steam bubbles, look cloudy, warp more, and adhere less than properly-dried nylon. It's nearly unprintable when wet. It should be oven-dried at around 150F / 65C for 4+ hours -- desiccant will not strip enough moisture from it. In fact, nylon will pull water out of used silica gel! Once dry, it should be stored with an aggressive desiccant (either bone-dry silica or preferably calcium chloride). It only takes a few hours of exposure to air for it to become excessively moist. Building a sealed drybox feed system is highly recommended to avoid exposed time during and between prints. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polycarbonate&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to nylon in that is is an aggressive water-absorber. It will look cloudy, produce steam bubbles, warp more, and provide very poor layer bonding when wet. It should be oven-dried at 180F / 80C if on a plastic spool (up to 250F / 120C if dried alone) for 4+ hours and then stored in a drybox with aggressive desiccant just like nylon. Note that some modern PC blends like Esun ePC are less prone to water absorption, at the cost of some decrease in mechanical properties. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PVA&lt;/strong&gt; is basically destroyed by airborne humidity, since it literally dissolves in water. Store in a drybox with an aggressive desiccant at all times. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Composite filaments should be treated like the base material. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some drying and prevention options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oven&lt;/strong&gt;: The &quot;warm&quot; setting will usually work pretty well. Let the oven preheat and settle out for a while, and measure temperature with a good oven thermometer or thermocouple. Shield the filament from direct radiant heating and hot spots with aluminum foil, cookie sheets, etc. Electric ovens will dry faster than gas ovens, because burning natural gas produces some additional moisture. Do not leave the oven unattended if using temperatures above the glass point of the filament, or bad things may happen!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Light bucket&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: A 5-gallon plastic bucket with an incandescent lightbulb inside is a pretty effective way to gently warm low-temp filament like PLA for drying or medium-term storage. Leave the lid slightly open if drying. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food dehydrator&lt;/strong&gt;: Works great. Set temperatures as per the oven temps above. The main challenge is getting a large enough space inside for a filament spool. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desiccant&lt;/strong&gt;: In order for desiccant to actively dry filament, it must be significantly more attractive to water than the filament is. And affinity for water is a function of how wet the material already is. That means dry desiccant can easily pull some water out of very wet filament, but wet desiccant can actually give water TO the filament! Rechargeable indicator desiccant (such as an &lt;em&gt;Eva-Dry E-333&lt;/em&gt; unit) is ideal. It's also important to have ENOUGH desiccant: silica gel can only absorb 10% of its weight in water at 20% RH. That means to pull 1% moisture content out of a wet 1kg spool, you would need to start with at least 100g of bone-dry, fresh-baked silica! &quot;Used&quot; silica is basically useless, it already contains too much water to pull any more from the filament. But you can re-dry the silica in an oven. 250F / 120C for 6 hours should be safe for all types of silica gel, but more aggressive drying (including microwave drying) is possible for some silica gels. Follow the gel manufacturer instructions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice&lt;/strong&gt;: Does not work. It's basically a myth that rice has drying power. A bag of rice you buy at the store is already pretty close to moisture equilibrium with the air, so it has minimal capacity to pull water from filament (or a soaked iPhone, for that matter). If you dry the rice in an oven to drive out its water first, it will work to some degree, but silica gel is considerably more effective. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitty litter&lt;/strong&gt;: Silica gel style kitty litter is nearly identical to desiccant silica gel. Like rice, it is fairly close to saturated when you open the container, but can be dried in the oven to be a good cheap bulk desiccant. Clay type kitty litter is not as effective. Be careful of getting kitty litter dust all over your filament. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry storage&lt;/strong&gt; A thick plastic box with an airtight seal is preferable. Look for recycling code 2 (HDPE) or 5 (PP) on the box. 5 gallon buckets with sealing lids also work fine. Ziplocks and other thin plastic bags are better than nothing, but are permeable to water (yes, really) and can only be relied on as long as there is fresh desiccant in the bag. Acrylic/plexiglas dryboxes have been sold by various people, but acrylic is very permeable to water, so I don't recommend that option. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air conditioning&lt;/strong&gt;: Simply keeping the air in your printing environment reasonably dry will protect PLA and ABS and other low-absorption filaments. It may help to buy a humidity monitor to get an understanding of your ambient humidity. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, considering the original question here, it's important to note that moisture content is not the only way filament can age or be damaged. PLA in particular is prone to becoming brittle over time. There are different theories for why this occurs. One is gradual chemical aging because poly(lactic acid) simply is not a very stable polymer. Moisture could contribute to that aging process, but true chemical aging would be irreversible even if the filament is later dried. How much this occurs should depend on the specific polymer blend and storage conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another theory for PLA aging is that the residual filament extrusion stresses (from being drawn down to the correct diameter and rapidly quenched in a water bath) are slowly creeping over time. Anyone who has placed a PLA part under heavy load for more than a few weeks will see PLA creep. It's a rather odd polymer in that it will &quot;creep to failure&quot; and crack at very low creep elongations rather than progressively deform in a ductile manner like most creep-prone materials. So if the PLA has significant stresses locked-in from the initial extrusion process (which is very common) it may be creeping into a more brittle arrangement of polymer molecules over time. That would explain the aging effect, and it would explain why &quot;drying&quot; sometimes rejuvenates the PLA: heating the filament near its glass point will allow the polymer molecules to gently relax and basically anneal to a less brittle state. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Most of the transparent PLAs I've used print much more clear at around 240°C.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ABS - I've seen some pretty impressive clear parts printed as a single layer shell in ABS and then vapor smoothed.

Printing slower and with less cooling sometimes helps.  It's easier to get the infill solid with a direct drive extruder, I couldn't get decent results with a long bowden tube (a short bowden tube works fine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a page where I tested 10 transparent filaments, the printed samples are 2mm thick, 100% infill - &lt;a href=&quot;http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments&quot;&gt;http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments&lt;/a&gt;.  Those samples are all overextruded a bit, you can get better results if you dial in the extrusion precisely, but that's hard to get right, and the optimal settings may change slightly depending on the part geometry.

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;Stringing is often a result of too-high a temperature, or insufficient retraction. When there is highly liquid filament in the nozzle tip, it can adhere to the remainder of the print while dripping as the nozzle moves, leading to a thin string of the filament forming. As further travel moves are performed in each layer, this turns to a web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The high temperature causes filament to be very liquid, causing it to move downward in the nozzle chamber easily, as opposed to having to be extruded forcefully due to viscosity. The temperature setpoint of 210 was high enough to cause this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second possible cause, insufficient retraction, can also be blamed for this issue. Retraction is a process in which the extruder reverses its movement to pull filament back up the hotend, preventing it from dripping at the tip, and forming a string. Most slicers will allow specifying a numeric value in millimeters of filament to be retracted. Remember that printers with Bowden tubes between nozzle/hotend and extruder motor will require increased retraction and priming (extrusion when starting to print after a retract-and-move). Note that too much retraction can cause other problems, such as insufficient plastic in the hotend chamber at the start of the next printing move, which can cause gaps and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

It takes in the molten filament (typically as a bead of 1.75mm/3mm) and tapers down to the nozzle size (typically around 0.4mm). These are typically made of brass for its good heat conductivity, but brass is not suitable for printing abrasive materials (such as glow in the dark and metal-filled filaments) so sometimes (hardened) stainless steel is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heater Block&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually made from aluminium, the heater block joins the nozzle to the heat break and holds the heater cartridge and thermistor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heater Cartridge&lt;/strong&gt;: most hotends use a ceramic heater cartridge, though some older designs use power resistors or nichrome wire. This component is, as the name suggests, responsible for heating up the hotend. The heat block usually clamps around the heater cartridge to provide good contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermistor&lt;/strong&gt;: This part senses the temperature of the heat block. It is usually a small glass bead with two wires attached (which are typically insulated with glass fiber or teflon). For high-temperature printing, a thermocouple may be used in stead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat Break&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the part where hot meets cold. It usually takes the form of a thin tube and is made of stainless steel for its low thermal conductivity. The goal is generally to have the transition be as short as possible so as little of the filament is in a molten state as possible. It connects the heat block to the heat sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat Sink&lt;/strong&gt;: the purpose of the heat sink is to cool down the cold side of the heat break. It is typically cooled with a fan. Most heat sinks also have a standard groove-mount for mounting to your printer. The heat sink usually has grooves to increase its surface area and cooling capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teflon Liner&lt;/strong&gt;: some hotends have a PTFE liner that guides the filament through the heat break into the nozzle. This makes it easier to print PLA, but compared to an all-metal hotend, limits the temperatures at which you can print (making it difficult to print PETG and impossible to print polycarbonate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ubis hotend you mentioned is a bit simpler than this, and simply uses a big chunk of PEEK in place of the heat break/sink. PEEK has very low thermal conductivity and thus passive cooling is sufficient. However, PEEK limits the temperatures at which you can print.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an illustration outlining these components on an E3D V6 hotend:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cjuNi.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cjuNi.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in this image the Teflon liner only goes into the heat sink, and not into the heat break or block. This means the maximum temperature is not limited by the Teflon, but if it did go all the way in (as is the case with, for instance, the Lite6) then it would be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;When you slice an STL of a heat tower, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you need to tell the slicer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that you need a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;different temperature at a certain level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and maintain that new temperature until another change is requested.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way I usually do it is by &lt;em&gt;using a post processing script in Ulltimaker Cura&lt;/em&gt;, but you can do it yourself quite easily &lt;em&gt;by changing the G-code file manually&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get it to work in Ultimaker Cura is to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;open a heat tower STL model onto the virtual build plate,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;choose the correct print settings, e.g. fan speed, print speed, layer thickness, etc.,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;now navigate from the main top menu bar &lt;code&gt;Extensions -&amp;gt; Post Processing -&amp;gt; Modify G-Code&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;select &lt;code&gt;Add a script&lt;/code&gt; and choose &lt;code&gt;ChangeAtZ&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you now are presented with an option (called &lt;code&gt;Trigger&lt;/code&gt;) that you can change options at either a certain &lt;code&gt;Height&lt;/code&gt; or at a certain &lt;code&gt;Layer No.&lt;/code&gt; number, you decide what you want to use based on the model and layersize used, but height can be chosen safely when you know the height changes in the heat tower model&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;set a certain height at which you want to change the print properties by specifying a height in option &lt;code&gt;Change Height&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;now put a checkmark in &lt;code&gt;Change Extruder 1 Temp&lt;/code&gt; (be sure that the box &lt;code&gt;Behavior&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;Keep value&lt;/code&gt; so that it maintains this value until you specify otherwise, else it is only valid for a single layer),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a new input box will be presented to you where you can enter the value of the extruder,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;repeat this adding of &quot;changes at certain height&quot; e.i. instances of &lt;code&gt;ChangeAtZ&lt;/code&gt; until you have specified all the temperatures for all the levels&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;now slice the model (if not done automatically) and save the G-code file for printing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look into the generated G-code file (the snippet below is taken from a G-code file for an Ultimaker 3) you will see that the post processing script will add extra lines in your G-code file. E.g. the following snippet shows you 2 changes of temperature, one at 5 mm (extruder 1 @ 250 &amp;deg;C), the other at 10 mm (extruder 1 @ 245 &amp;deg;C):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...&#xA;;LAYER:48&#xA;G0 X93.4 Y132.161 Z5&#xA;;ChangeAtZ V5.1.1: executed at 5.00 mm&#xA;M117 Printing... ch@  5.0&#xA;M104 S250.000000 T0&#xA;...&#xA;...&#xA;;LAYER:98&#xA;G0 X93.4 Y132.35 Z10&#xA;;ChangeAtZ V5.1.1: executed at 10.00 mm&#xA;M117 Printing... ch@ 10.0&#xA;M104 S245.000000 T0&#xA;...&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the extruder needs to be instructed to be heated or cooled to a new temperature. This is also something you could have inserted yourself manually by adding the codes &lt;code&gt;M104 SXXX.000000 T0&lt;/code&gt; at specific levels where &lt;code&gt;XXX&lt;/code&gt; is the extruder temperature you need for that level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically this describes &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how to print&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the heat tower calibration prints, not &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the selection of the settings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. extruder temperature) to use for your prints. When you created the print file you are ready to print the tower and observe the quality of printing. You can look at the print and visually inspect the temperature giving you the best aesthetic performance, the best overhang performance, the best &quot;filling&quot; performance, highest speed, etc. It is &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; that decides what is best for your application. Alternatively you could print some coupon tests and see which are structurally the best. Please note that additional towers for different settings like layer height, print part cooling and print speed to may be necessary to optimize the print process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sidemark, I prefer the use of parametric models (e.g. in OpenSCAD) over the STL models found on the internet, this way I can embed the exact printer setting in the tower for reference.

    <score Score="21"/>
    <topAnswer>
      <score Score="22"/>
      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons (I can think of):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large problem you'd face with allowing the bed to cool after first layer is you stand the chance of losing adhesion after it cools. When you heat the bed, it expands somewhat. When it cools it contracts. It has been known for parts to actually pop off the bed if left on there to cool (after a print). If you allow the bed to cool fully, you could ruin a print due to it losing the adhesion, popping off the bed, then the printer keeps on going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're dealing with 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm layer height, that's not a lot of wiggle room. When you level your bed before printing, it should be done after everything is heated. If you were to turn off the bed after you start printing, you could very easily shift the bed enough to take up the worth of an entire layer, which means your print has adjusted and will then have major imperfections. This isn't a &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt;, but definitely a concern ... especially for larger or taller prints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether PLA or PETG, the extruded filament needs to have heat in order to stay. This is not only heat in the extruder, but heat in the print itself. If the print cools off, this could affect subsequent adhesion for the filament getting laid down. If you turn the bed heater off after print start, you'll lose that heated environment. The print will cool off and you'll start seeing variations in the print, which, if the print is large enough, would most likely be more noticable. Think of it as a heated environment, not just putting piling host plastic on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be other reasons, but I believe these are &lt;em&gt;very good&lt;/em&gt; reasons not to turn your bed off after print start. If you are worried your power supply isn't providing enough power, then get a bigger power supply. If you're worried about power consumption overall, once the bed is heated, consumption goes way down (as @r_ahlskog stated in their answer). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

If you have sandpaper made out of metal (ie stainless pla), it will scratch your skin fairly easily. If you have sandpaper made out of tree bark (ie laywood pla), it probably won't scratch your skin as bad, but it'll still scratch. And just for poops and giggles, lets say you have sandpaper made out of pla; it'll take a while, but you could eventually make your skin raw if you rub the plastic against your arm long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is typically recommended to use one nozzle for each material type as to avoid cross-contamination of materials in your printing.

I'm not sure if all slicing engines provide this option, but I know MakerWare/MakerBot Desktop and (possibly) Slic3r allow this setting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, when you're extruding smaller features like this, the previous layer(s) are still very hot and possibly very pliable. So, as your nozzle moves around above the previous layer, the nozzle may (and probably will) push some of this molten plastic around. Chances are you can see it to a certain degree while it's printing. You can definitely see this in a most drastic state if you print a tall and small diameter cylinder. You'll notice that the part will become almost exponentially unstable the higher it goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the time your printer takes to print a single layer, you are allowing the previous layer(s) to cool closer to the ambient temperature of the build space, and hopefully not as molten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abcgroup3.com/toolbox/mold_cooling_calc.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this calculator&lt;/a&gt; or a similar one for material cooling times. For a standard shell setting of about 2-3 (0.4mm nozzle) will yield about 130sec to cool down to room temperature. I would recommend (for ABS/PLA at least) about a 15second minimum for each layer, possibly longer depending on the size and spread out of the features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that this can be cheated by simply printing multiple items in the same build plate with the same heights (ie. multiples of the same part). Naturally, it will take longer for the machine to print the rest of the parts and therefore allow each layer to cool slightly before being printed over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Active Cooling&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, some slicing engines have an Active Cooling setting. I don't personally have this option setup on my machine, but I believe it regulates the flow of air directed at your nozzle (usually by use of a mounted fan). This can help cool the layers a bit faster. With ABS, this might result in some pretty bad warping mid-print.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Feedrates&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try bringing down your feedrates to provide the printed portions of the current layer more time to cool if the above options aren't available. Note that you might also bring down your hotend temp to shorten the time it takes to cool the plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;All else fails&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only other suggestion is stated above, try printing duplicates on the same plate. My diagnosis is that the previous layers aren't cooling down enough before the next layer begins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

Should you learn to use those features, you get the best of both types of software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you construct your model in the software in segments/pieces as you suggest, your result will have greater flexibility at the printing stage, specifically with respect to color and filament choices.

Constant probe offset values are now found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/blob/master/config/default/Configuration_adv.h&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Configuration_adv.h&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;MIN_PROBE_EDGE_LEFT&#xA;MIN_PROBE_EDGE_RIGHT&#xA;MIN_PROBE_EDGE_FRONT&#xA;MIN_PROBE_EDGE_BACK&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;HINT for Marlin &amp;gt;= 2.0.6&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since version&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases/tag/2.0.6&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2.0.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;MIN_PROBE_EDGE_*&lt;/code&gt; has been renamed again.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/blob/c322f2c8d79e4e72e1b50939a9ae659be8260a2d/config/examples/Micromake/C1/enhanced/Configuration_adv.h#L1882&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Now it is&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PROBING_MARGIN_LEFT&#xA;PROBING_MARGIN_RIGHT&#xA;PROBING_MARGIN_FRONT&#xA;PROBING_MARGIN_BACK&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in Marlin 1.1.x the boundaries are set in absolute positions while in Marlin 2.0.x it is described in offset values from the bed edge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sensor Offset&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The position of the sensor is set using the following constants:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;#define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER [XXX]   // X offset: -left  +right  [of the nozzle]&#xA;#define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER [YYY]   // Y offset: -front +behind [the nozzle]&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;[XXX]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[YYY]&lt;/code&gt; are offset values that specify the center of the sensor with respect to the nozzle. If both are positive values, the sensor is located in the back-right, if both negative, the position is front-left (as seen from the front of the machine using the definition in the Marlin configuration file). The other positions that are possible are the back-left and the front-right (one positive and one negative value).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;HINT for Marlin 2.x&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in Marlin 2.x, these constants are replace by an array definition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { XXX, YYY, ZZZ }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;ZZZ&lt;/code&gt; is the Z offset. If you use the old constants, the sanity check upon compiling will throw an assertion that these constants are not in use anymore and should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, let's set the sensor area limits!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sensor Area Limits&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the following images, the nozzle, the sensor and the offsets are defined by:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HfYc5.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Legend of nozzle, sensor and offset&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HfYc5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Legend of nozzle, sensor and offset&quot; title=&quot;Legend of nozzle, sensor and offset&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are four possible positions of the sensor, this results in the following schematics for the sensor area limits (transparent red area):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;1. Sensor at the back-right:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VwcWg.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VwcWg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This implies that the sensor can reach the back and the right borders, so the limits are set by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;#define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER)&#xA;#define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_BED_SIZE)&#xA;#define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER)&#xA;#define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_BED_SIZE)&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that if a minimum probe offset is defined by &lt;code&gt;#define MIN_PROBE_EDGE [value] &lt;/code&gt; in the configuration (to account for sensor width/dimension), the bed limits are changed resulting in (where t = &lt;code&gt;MIN_PROBE_EDGE&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AUeGF.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe with MIN_PROBE_EDGE offset&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AUeGF.png&quot; alt=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe with MIN_PROBE_EDGE offset&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe with MIN_PROBE_EDGE offset&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Limits are then set by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;#define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER + MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_BED_SIZE - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER + MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_BED_SIZE - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the following sensor position placements, this offset for &lt;code&gt;MIN_PROBE_EDGE&lt;/code&gt; will be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;2. Sensor at the back-left:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1LVk.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-left probe&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1LVk.png&quot; alt=&quot;Probe area for back-left probe&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-left probe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This implies that the sensor can reach the back and the left borders (for zero &lt;code&gt;MIN_PROBE_EDGE&lt;/code&gt;), so the limits are set by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;#define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_BED_SIZE  + X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER + MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_BED_SIZE - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;3. Sensor at the front-left:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzBDr.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for front-left probe&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzBDr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Probe area for front-left probe&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for front-left probe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This implies that the sensor can reach the front and the left borders (for zero &lt;code&gt;MIN_PROBE_EDGE&lt;/code&gt;), so the limits are set by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;#define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_BED_SIZE  + X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_BED_SIZE + Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;4. Sensor at the front-right:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HV7I.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HV7I.png&quot; alt=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This implies that the sensor can reach the front and the right borders (for zero &lt;code&gt;MIN_PROBE_EDGE&lt;/code&gt;), so the limits are set by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;#define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER + MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_BED_SIZE  - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_BED_SIZE + Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This should have tackled the basics for defining the sensor area limits. It becomes a little more complicated when there is extra travel space. A very easy use of extra travel space can be found in the configuration file; e.g:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;// Travel limits (mm) after homing, corresponding to endstop positions.&#xA;#define X_MIN_POS [XX]&#xA;#define Y_MIN_POS [YY]&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;[XX]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[YY]&lt;/code&gt; are offset values from endstop to origin (orange arrows represent &lt;code&gt;X_MIN_POS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y_MIN_POS&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jr7Yb.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe including homing endstop offsets&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jr7Yb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe including homing endstop offsets&quot; title=&quot;Probe area for back-right probe including homing endstop offsets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;Results in offset constants for a back-right probe:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;#define LEFT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER + X_MIN_POS + MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (X_BED_SIZE - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define FRONT_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER + Y_MIN_POS + MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;#define BACK_PROBE_BED_POSITION (Y_BED_SIZE - MIN_PROBE_EDGE)&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For all other options, a similar addition of the homing offsets can applied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A similar addition is possible if the print head is able to travel further on the X or Y axis at the other ends of the axes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts for solution for Marlin 2.0.x&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, Marlin 2.0.x uses bed edge offsets rather than absolute positions. In analogy of the previous graphs we can draw a bed limits diagram (&lt;em&gt;the example below assumes a back-right mounted probe!&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BesT8.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/BesT8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Marlin 2.0.x bed sensor limits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the offsets from the edge need to be defined, to properly do this we need access to the definition of the nozzle offset:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { XXX, YYY, ZZZ }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As this is the part that defines the array values, you first need to make an array (note that this is a simple solution that many people should be able to understand with limited programming skills, more elegant solutions use the XYZ struct to access the X, Y or Z properties):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that Marlin 2.0.x automatically adjusts your probe area based on the defined offset and the &lt;code&gt;MIN_PROBE_EDGE&lt;/code&gt; defined for all 4 sides of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/2.0.x/Marlin/Configuration_adv.h&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#if PROBE_SELECTED &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !IS_KINEMATIC&#xA;  #define MIN_PROBE_EDGE_LEFT MIN_PROBE_EDGE&#xA;  #define MIN_PROBE_EDGE_RIGHT MIN_PROBE_EDGE&#xA;  #define MIN_PROBE_EDGE_FRONT MIN_PROBE_EDGE&#xA;  #define MIN_PROBE_EDGE_BACK MIN_PROBE_EDGE&#xA;#endif&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;I found the answer myself just after posting - I'm posting it because it might be helpful to other Cura novices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a setting for this, it's just that it's not shown by default. In print settings, you have to click on the three lines next to the search box, and select &quot;Show All Settings&quot;. Then you can find a setting called &quot;Top/Bottom Pattern&quot;. Setting this to &quot;concentric&quot; does what I described. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually this setting affects not just the top and bottom layers, but all layers that are part of the top and bottom shell. This seems like a good thing, but if you really want to affect &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the bottom layer, there's a setting &quot;Bottom Pattern Initial Layer&quot; that does this. There is also a setting under &quot;Experimental&quot; called &quot;Top Surface Skin Pattern&quot; that I think does the same for just the top layer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &quot;Concentric&quot; there is also a &quot;Zig Zag&quot; option that's quite similar to the default &quot;Lines&quot; mode.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also change the visibility of settings in the preferences menu, to make these settings show up by default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>

      <body Body="&lt;p&gt;I believe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://manual.slic3r.org/first-print/first-layer&quot;&gt;Slic3r Manual&lt;/a&gt; summarizes this quite nicely:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A thicker layer height will provide more flow, and consequently more heat, making the extrusion adhere to the bed more. It also gives the benefit of giving more tolerance for the levelness of the bed. It is recommended to raise the first layer height to match the diameter of the nozzle, e.g. a first layer height of 0.35mm for a 0.35mm nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, larger layer heights for the first layer typically gives better adhesion, and makes inaccurate bed leveling (and auto leveling) still work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"/>
